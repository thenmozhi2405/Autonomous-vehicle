# Autonomous-vehicle
Autonomous car using raspberry pi with features like object avoidance, lane following, traffic sign and signal detection, autonomous parking and V2X communication.
Lane detection and traffic sign and signal detection are done using Machine learning models .
V2X communication is done between 2 ESP32 as communication meduim .
object avoidance and parking are done using Ultrasonic sensor.
I have invluded all required codes for these features separately .
Downlode training and testing dataset and run the code.
